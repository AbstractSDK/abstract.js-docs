# `@abstract-money/cli` [One command to rule them all!]

The Abstract CLI is a command-line tool for generating JavaScript bindings to contracts that use Abstract.

:::info
If you have `tsconfig.json` in your project, it will generate TypeScript typings too!
:::

:::warning
The CLI package relies heavily on [ts-codegen](https://github.com/CosmWasm/ts-codegen).
:::

## Installation 

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i @abstract-money/cli
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @abstract-money/cli
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @abstract-money/cli
```

```bash [bun]
bun add @abstract-money/cli
```

:::

## Usage

```bash
abstract <command> [options]
```

## Init

Once you have installed the CLI, you need to define the CLI config in `abstract.config.ts`.
You can generate a default configuration using the command:

```bash
abstract init
```

This will generate an `abstract.config.ts` in your project root. You can then configure it according to your needs.

## Configuration

Here's an example of how to configure `abstract.config.ts`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@abstract-money/cli'
import { react, registry, vanilla } from '@abstract-money/cli/plugins'

export default defineConfig({
  // Target directory for generated files.
  out: './src/generated',

  // Define contracts for which to generate bindings
  // Use this for contracts not registered in the Abstract schemas repository
  contracts: [
    {
      name: "exampleAdapter",
      path: "../contracts/exampleAdapter/schema/",
      namespace: "your-namespace", 
      version: "0.1.0",
      moduleType: "adapter", // Specify this if it's an adapter module
    },
    // You can add more contracts here as needed
  ],

  // List of plugins to use.
  plugins: [
    // Generate React hooks.
    react(),
    // Pull contract schemas from the registry at https://github.com/AbstractSDK/schemas
    registry({
      contracts: [
        {
          name: 'app-name', // Your App Name.
          namespace: 'abstract', // To claim a namespace on mainnet, please get in touch with Abstract Team.
          version: '0.1.0',
        },
      ],
    }),

    // Generate vanilla JavaScript bindings
    vanilla({
      // Enable Abstract App features for specific contracts
      enableAbstractAppFor: ['exampleAdapter']
    }),
  ],
})
```

### Generating for Contracts Not Registered in Schemas Repository

To generate bindings for contracts that are not registered in the Abstract schemas repository, you can use the `contracts` array in the configuration. Specify the `name`, `path` to the schema, `namespace`, and `version` for each contract.

### Generating for Adapter Modules

When generating bindings for adapter modules, make sure to include `moduleType: "adapter"` in the contract configuration object.

### Enabling Abstract App Features

If you're working with an Abstract app, you can use the `vanilla` plugin with the `enableAbstractAppFor` option. This option takes an array of contract names for which you want to enable Abstract App features.

## Generate
Once done, you're ready to generate the code:

```bash
abstract generate
```

You can use additional options as mentioned above.
You should get an output like:

```sh
❯ abstract generate
✔ Validating plugins
✔ Resolving contracts
✔ Validating contracts
✔ Running plugins
✔ Writing to src/generated/index.ts
```

And you should be all set to use the types generated directly into your codebase.
