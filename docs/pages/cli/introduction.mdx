# `@abstract-money/cli` [One command to rule them all!]

The Abstract CLI is a command-line tool for generating JavaScript bindings to contracts that use Abstract.

:::info
If you have `tsconfig.json` in your project, it will generate TypeScript typings too!
:::

:::warning
The CLI package relies hardly on [ts-codegen](https://github.com/CosmWasm/ts-codegen).

## Installation 

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i @abstract-money/cli
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @abstract-money/cli
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @abstract-money/cli
```

```bash [bun]
bun add @abstract-money/cli
```

:::

## Usage

```bash
abstract <command> [options]
```

## Init

Once you have installed the CLI, you have to define CLI config at `abstract.config.ts`.
You can generate a default one, using the command:

```bash
abstract init
```

This will generate an `abstract.config.ts` in your project root. You can configure accordingly.

```ts twoslash
import { defineConfig } from '@abstract-money/cli'
import { react, registry } from '@abstract-money/cli/plugins'

export default defineConfig({
  // Target directory for generated files.
  out: './src/generated',
  // List of plugins to use.
  plugins: [
    // Generate React hooks.
    react(),
    // Pull contract schemas from the registry at https://github.com/AbstractSDK/schemas
    registry({
      contracts: [
        {
          name: 'app-name', // Your App Name.
          namespace: 'abstract', // To claim a namespace on mainnet, please get in touch with Abstract Team.
          version: '0.1.0',
        },
      ],
    }),
  ],
})
```

## Generate
Once done, you're ready to generate the code:

```bash
abstract generate
```

You can use additional options as mentioned above.
You should get an output like:

```sh
❯ abstract generate
✔ Validating plugins
✔ Resolving contracts
✔ Validating contracts
✔ Running plugins
✔ Writing to src/generated/index.ts
```

And you should be all set to use the types generated directly into your codebase.
