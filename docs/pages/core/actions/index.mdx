# Abstract.js Actions

Abstract.js is built to a modular standard similar to [viem](https://viem.sh) and allows for extending any client with additional actions.

## Extending the clients

You can extend the client with additional actions by using the `extend` method. This method allows you to add additional actions to the client.

```tsx twoslash
import { createApiClient } from '@abstract-money/core'

const apiClient = createApiClient({ apiUrl: 'https://api.abstract.money' })

const extendedClient = apiClient.extend(() => { // [!code focus]
  return { // [!code focus]
    getData: async () => Promise.resolve('data') // [!code focus]
  } // [!code focus]
}) // [!code focus]
```

You can create your own actions package, such as the `@abstract-money/actions-xion` package for custom functionality.
